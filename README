  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel. For example:

	%> cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
	%> git whatchanged <kernel_version>/standard/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyLF0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x88000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x82000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02800000;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \ (J721E EVM)
console=$consoledev,$baudrate earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02880000;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \ (J784S4 EVM)
tftp $fdtaddr $fdtfile;booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
loadaddr=0x82000000
fdtaddr=0x88000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
bootfile=Image
fdtfile=k3-j721e-common-proc-board.dtb (J721E EVM)
fdtfile=k3-j784s4-evm.dtb (J784S4 EVM)
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS2
baudrate=115200

5. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

5.1 Build WIC image within sysfw.itb & tiboot3.bin in boot partition (J721E EVM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sysfw.itb & tiboot3.bin are the firmwares of TI's MCU. Because of license issue,
they aren't integrated into WRLinux.

The TI's bootloader tar package "boot-j7-evm.tar.gz" includes the two firmwares,
they can be downloaded from website:
https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-J721E/

And then add one line below to local.conf:

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES:append = " <path-to-sysfw.itb>/sysfw.itb;sysfw.itb <path-to-tiboot3.bin>/tiboot3.bin;tiboot3.bin"

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-j72xx/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j72xx.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

5.1 Build WIC image within tiboot3.bin in boot partition (J784S4 EVM)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

tiboot3.bin are the firmwares of TI's MCU. Because of license issue,
they aren't integrated into WRLinux.

The TI's bootloader tar package "boot-adas-j784s4-evm.tar.gz" includes the two firmwares,
they can be downloaded from website:
https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-J784S4

And then add one line below to local.conf:

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES:append = " <path-to-tiboot3.bin>/tiboot3.bin;tiboot3.bin"

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-j78xx/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

5.2 Deploy the created WIC image
--------------------------------

Deploy the created WIC image into SD card(/dev/sdx) in your host machine.

   $ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-<machine>.wic of=/dev/sdx

5.3 Boot the board from the WIC SD card
---------------------------------------

Insert the SD card into the board and select this SD card as the boot device.

You have two ways to start the board:

1. Use the ubootâ€™s default startup environment variables.

2. By set the below uboot environment variables:
For J721E EVM:
   $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS2,115200n8 earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02800000 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootwait ip=dhcp
   $ fatload mmc 1:1 0x82000000 Image; fatload mmc 1:1 0x88000000 k3-j721e-common-proc-board.dtb; booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

For J784S4 EVM:
   $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS2,115200n8 earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02880000 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootwait ip=dhcp
   $ fatload mmc 1:1 0x82000000 Image; fatload mmc 1:1 0x88000000 k3-j784s4-evm.dtb; booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

Note:
If the IPC feature is enabled, about how to enable IPC please refer to the
section 6.2 for detail, it first needs to run "rproc init;run boot_rprocs_mmc" in u-boot to
load other core's firmware to avoid the kernel using RPMSG to interact with
other cores and get unanswered. Like below:
   $ rproc init;run boot_rprocs_mmc;fatload mmc 1:1 0x82000000 Image; fatload mmc 1:1 0x88000000 <board>.dtb; booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

6. Features
===========

Before using the features below, it is recommended that you first add
WRTEMPLATE to your build local.conf to add series tools (Such as: can/audio/ufs).

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:
	WRTEMPLATE = "feature/bsp-extras"

And it is recommended to refer to the "Foundational Components" of the sdk
release note "Processor SDK Linux for J721e/J784S4" from the TI web.

6.1 CAN
-------

6.1.1 Verify
------------

Detail verification commands as below:

	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 5000000 fd on
	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 5000000 fd on
	# candump can0 &
	# cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	# ip -d -s link show can0
	# ip -d -s link show can1

If can0 dumps data from can1, CAN feature works fine.

6.2 IPC
-------

The J7 SOC has integrated ARM Cortex A72 and others cores like: Cortex-R5F cores, C71x and C66X DSPs.
Through the CPSW9g virtual MAC, Cortex A72 can communicate with the remote cores using rpmsg.

In order to verify the IPC feature, need to build wrlinux with below steps:

Add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

	KERNEL_FEATURES:append = " bsp/ti-j7xxx/ti-j7xxx-remoteproc.scc"

Built and install them:

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-xxx

Initialize all the available remote cores in the u-boot:
	$ rproc init;run boot_rprocs_mmc;

Then booting the system, the cores firmwares will be auto-download and get the
response.

By default, the kernel config "CONFIG_SAMPLE_RPMSG_CLIENT" is enabled, the rpmsg
client sample is available to simple test the IPC feature. In the booting stage
it demonstrates how to communicate with an AMP-configured remote processor
over the rpmsg bus.

Note:
Since both the u-boot and linux kernel download the firmwares from the
rootfs directory "/lib/firmware", so NFS is not applicable to this case.
Only WIC mode works fine.

6.3 Watchdog (J721E EVM)
------------------------

In order to use watchdog, the configuration switch on J721EX-PM2-SOM board should be set with:

SW2.1=OFF, SW2.2=ON, SW3.1=ON, SW3.2=OFF

6.3.1 Usage and verification
----------------------------

        # echo 1 > /dev/watchdog

6.4 UFS (J721E EVM)
-------------------

6.4.1 Usage and verification
----------------------------

Running the commands in u-boot to scan the Universal Flash Subsystem (UFS)
devices.
	=> ufs init
	=> scsi scan

If no relevant device was found, please refer to the following link for more
information:
	https://e2e.ti.com/support/processors/f/791/t/922975

6.5 Graphics
------------

J721E/J784S4 device is enabled with 3D graphics accelerator based on the Rogue 8XE/MG BXS-64-4 series
from Imagination Technologies Inc. 3D-graphics apps call userspace libraries to drive
the GPU directly by the graphics driver.

Due to the software license terms, we are not permitted to redistribute these components.
Due to this, we are unable to support the components (ti-img-rogue-driver, img-pvr-sdk and
ti-img-rogue-umlibs) or directly enable them (ti-img-rogue-driver, img-pvr-sdk and
ti-img-rogue-umlibs) within Wind River Linux. Please contact your silicon vendor if you have
any questions about the software license terms.

As below is the step how to build a graphics enabled system and verify the graphics feature:

6.5.1 Build Image
-----------------

  1) set BB_NO_NETWORK as '0' in <path-of-project>/build/conf/local.conf file.

  2) Launch bitbake to build an image with graphics support

     $ cd path_to_your_project
     $ . ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux
     $ . ./oe-init-build-env
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
DISTRO ?= "wrlinux-graphics"
MACHINE_FEATURES += " gpu"
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:wr-ti-j7xxx += 'img-pvr-sdk'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-ti-bsp += 'ti-img-rogue-umlibs ti-img-rogue-driver mesa-pvr devil'
_EOF
     $ bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

6.6 Video
---------

J721E has the following hardware accelerators:
Multi-Standard HD Video Decoder (DECODER) based on D5520MP2 from Imagination
Technologies for accelerating multimedia decode.
Multi-Standard HD Video Encoder (ENCODER) based on VXE384MP2 from Imagination
Technologies for accelerating multimedia encode.

The Encoder/Decoder (VENC/VDEC) is found on the J784S4 SoC. Combined H.264 and H.265
encoder/decoder used in the Texas Instruments J784S4 SoC.

The Linux Kernel Drivers has integrated the Video Decoder and Encoder as module by default.
Because of the license issue, you can manually build the Image as below to
integrate the gstreamer related packages:

6.6.1 Build Image
-----------------

  1) set BB_NO_NETWORK as '0' in ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf file.

  2) Add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:openembedded-layer += 'faad2'
LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED += "commercial"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append:ti-j7 = ' gstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav'
_EOF

  3) bitbake wrlinux-image-xxx

6.6.2 Verify Multimedia feature
-------------------------------

An example to test with GStreamer Pipelines on target board:
J721E EVM:
	$ gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file>  ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! v4l2h264dec ! videoconvert ! v4l2h264enc ! filesink location=/<path_to_file>

J784S4 EVM:
	$ gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file>  ! rawvideoparse width=1920 height=1080 format=i420 framerate=30/1 colorimetry=bt709 ! v4l2h264enc ! filesink location=/<path_to_file>  sync=true

6.7 Build U-Boot
----------------

By default, the u-boot image is compiled and installed. If you want u-boot to be manually
compiled separately, use the following commandï¼š

	# bitbake u-boot-ti-staging

6.8 OSPI Flash (J784S4 EVM)
---------------------------

In order to use OSPI Flash, the configuration switch on J784s4 EVM board should be set with:

SW2.1=OFF

6.9 USB (J784S4 EVM)
--------------------

The J784S4-EVB supports a single USB interface. Therefore, the user must configure
for either the USB3.1 Type C interface [J4] or the USB2.0 Type A interface [J5]. Both can not
be operated simultaneously. The default system is the USB3.1 Type C interface, in order to
switch to the USB2.0 Type A interface, using the command on WRLinux shell:
	$ gpioset -c1 -t0 --hold-period 20ms 12=1

Otherwise switch to the USB3.1 Type C interface, using the command on WRLinux shell:
	$ gpioset -c1 -t0 --hold-period 20ms 12=0

Note: same as TI SDK, the bottom port of the two USB2.0 ports can not recognize
U disk, the top port of the two USB2.0 ports works fine.

6.9.1 USB3.1 Host
-----------------

The configuration switch on J784s4 EVM board should be set with:
    SW2.[4:3] = 00

6.9.2 USB3.1 Device
-------------------

The configuration switch on J784s4 EVM board should be set with:
    SW2.[4:3] = 1X, X is 0 or 1

In addition to the method which modifies "dr_mode" property in dts file, you can change this property
by using "fdt" u-boot command. The example for USB device mode is as described below:

	=> tftpboot 0x82000000 Image; tftpboot 0x88000000 dtb
	=> fdt addr 0x88000000; fdt resize; fdt set /bus@100000/cdns-usb@4104000/usb@6000000 dr_mode peripheral
	=> booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

6.10 Vision Apps
----------------

Vision Apps is a component within Processor SDK RTOS.

Vision Apps integrates different components within Processor SDK RTOS (PSDK RTOS)
like SysBIOS, PDK, OpenVX, Algorithms to realize system applications for vision
processing like surround view.

Vision Apps can be built or directly picked as out of the Box Demos from TI,
prebuilt PSDK RTOS and Demo Data can be obtained though TI's technical support.
It is recommended that you first refer to this guide document "out_of_box_j784s4.html"
while using the vision apps.

In order to run vision apps with full features on WRLinux, WRLinux should be built with:
	1. Modify the ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf to add:

	   $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
WRTEMPLATE = "feature/bsp-extras"
KERNEL_FEATURES:append = " bsp/ti-j7xxx/ti-j7xxx-remoteproc.scc"
_EOF
	2. Enable Graphics feature, please refer to "6.5.1 Build Image"
	3. Add vision-apps & tidl & tiovx related packages, it needs to enable the previous
	   graphic feature first. Add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

	   $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:openembedded-layer += 'yaml-cpp'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:openembedded-layer += 'glm'
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:meta-edgeai +=  'ti-vision-apps ti-tidl edgeai-apps-utils edgeai-tiovx-kernels edgeai-tiovx-modules ti-edgeai-firmware edgeai-tiovx-apps'
IMAGE_INSTALL:append:ti-j7 = ' ti-vision-apps-dev ti-tidl-dev edgeai-apps-utils-source edgeai-tiovx-kernels-dev edgeai-tiovx-kernels-source edgeai-tiovx-modules-dev edgeai-tiovx-modules-source ti-edgeai-firmware edgeai-tiovx-apps-dev edgeai-tiovx-apps-source'
_EOF
	4. Add meta-ti-extras layer:
	   $ bitbake-layers add-layer <path_to_project>/layers/meta-ti/meta-ti-extras

Run vision apps on EVM target in WRLinux + RTOS mode (via SD card boot) with below
steps:

6.10.1 Usage and verification
-----------------------------

Step 1: Download Prebuilt PSDK RTOS

	$ cd {path/to/file}
	$ tar xf ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j784s4-evm-<version>-prebuilt.tar.gz

Step 2: Download Demo Data Sets
	psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx.tar.gz
	psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx_j784s4.tar.gz

Step 3: Prepare SD card
	$ sudo ./mk-linux-card.sh /dev/sdx

Note: make sure to give the correct device name to the following script, example
/dev/sda is typically local hard disk.

Step 4: Copy WRLinux Filesystem and Modify script
For J721E EVM:
	$ cp path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-j72xx/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j72xx.tar.bz2 .
	$ sed -i "s/tisdk-default-image-j7-evm.tar.xz/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j72xx.tar.bz2/;41s/-xf/-jxf/" install_to_sd_card.sh
For J784S4 EVM:
	$ cp path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-j78xx/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.tar.bz2 .
	$ sed -i 's/tisdk-adas-image-j784s4-evm.tar.xz/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.tar.bz2/;40s/-xf/-jxf/' install_to_sd_card.sh

Note: for the name wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.tar.bz2, rootfs_type needs to be
specified according to the rootfs type, like std or sato.

Step 5: Install Filesystem and Boot Files
	$ ./install_to_sd_card.sh
	$ ./install_data_set_to_sd_card.sh <path/to/psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx.tar.gz>
	$ ./install_data_set_to_sd_card.sh <path/to/psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx_<machine>.tar.gz>

Step 6: Run on EVM
 First time only:
	$ env default -a -f
	$ reset

 Run series demos:
	$ cd /opt/vision_apps
	$ source ./vision_apps_init.sh
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/python3.11/site-packages/dnf:/usr/lib
	$ ./run_app_tidl_avp.sh                 - Auto valet parking demo (needs display)

6.10.2 CPSW9G virtual mac client
--------------------------------

The vision app prebuilt PSDK RTOS provides the Eth-Switch Firmware running on the R5F core
can configure CPSW9G instance of CPSW, exporting a dedicated Linux MAC only port and Switch
ports, which can be interfaced with using the Virt MAC Client driver.

Detail information can refer to "3.2.2.10.3.2.3.1. CPSWng virtual MAC
(remoteproc)" of the SDK document. The created virtual mac port as below:

	root@ti-j78xx:/# ethtool -i eth2
	driver: j721e-cpsw-virt-mac
	version: 0.1
	firmware-version: 0.2.0 14/Aug/2023 SHA:
	expansion-rom-version:
	bus-info: main-r5fss-cpsw9g-virt-mac0
	supports-statistics: no
	supports-test: yes
	supports-eeprom-access: no
	supports-register-dump: no
	supports-priv-flags: no

6.11 CPSW9g Native Ethernet
---------------------------

The CPSW9g ethernet subsystem can be controlled by the am65-cpsw-nuss driver
in Linux to provide standard ethernet features such as MAC mode, Switch mode,
VLAN and TSN features.

For validating native ethernet, the card "J7X-VSC8514-ETH rev E2" needs to
install in the ENET Expansion 1 slot of target board, and needs to apply
the device-tree overlays at U-Boot.

In addition to other environment variables, the following environment variables
need to be set additionally at uboot to apply dtbo files:

        => tftpboot 0x82000000 Image; tftpboot 0x88000000 dtb

For J721E EVM
	=> fdt address 0x88000000; fdt resize 0x100000; tftpboot 0x89000000 k3-j721e-evm-quad-port-eth-exp.dtbo;fdt apply 0x89000000;
For J784S4 EVM:
	=> fdt address 0x88000000; fdt resize 0x100000; tftpboot 0x89000000 k3-j784s4-evm-quad-port-eth-exp1.dtbo;fdt apply 0x89000000;

        => booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

Note:
    CPSWng Virtual Client and CPSW9g Native Ethernet are mutually exclusive.

6.11.1 MAC Mode
---------------
By default, the installed J7X-VSC8514-ETH ports are configured to start with MAC Mode.
MAC mode supports multiple independent Ethernet interfaces with complete isolation.

6.11.2 Switch Mode
------------------
The Switch mode can be enabled by below configuring:

	$ ifconfig eth1 down
	$ ifconfig eth2 down
	$ ifconfig eth3 down
	$ ifconfig eth4 down

	$ devlink dev param set platform/c000000.ethernet name switch_mode value true cmode runtime
	$ ip link add name br0 type bridge
	$ ip link set dev br0 type bridge ageing_time 1000
	$ ip link set dev eth1 up
	$ ip link set dev eth2 up
	$ ip link set dev eth3 up
	$ ip link set dev eth4 up
	$ ip link set dev eth1 master br0
	$ ip link set dev eth2 master br0
