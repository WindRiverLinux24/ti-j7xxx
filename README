2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-std-sato |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |        Y         |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel. For example:

	%> cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
	%> git whatchanged <kernel_version>/standard/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyLF0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x88000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x82000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02880000;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \
tftp $fdtaddr $fdtfile;booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
loadaddr=0x82000000
fdtaddr=0x88000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
bootfile=Image
fdtfile=k3-j784s4-evm.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS2
baudrate=115200

5. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-j78xx/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

5.1 An example to deploy bootloader into the first partition
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Deploy the created WIC image into SD card(/dev/sdx) in your host machine.

   $ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.wic of=/dev/sdx

2) Deploy the TI's bootloader files {tiboot3.bin and uenv*} into this /dev/sdx1

   $ sudo mount /dev/sdx1 path_to_sdx1
   $ cp path_to_your_bootloader/{tiboot3.bin and uenv*} path_to_sdx1
   $ sync; sudo umount path_to_sdx1

Note:
1. The TI's bootloader tar package "boot-j784s4-evm.tar.gz" can be downloaded
through TI's technical support.
2. The TI's bootloader files u-boot.img & tispl.bin have been compiled and integrated into
WRLinux WIC, they do not need to copy from TI SDK.

5.2 Boot the board from the WIC SD card

---------------------------------------
Insert the SD card into the board and select this SD card as the boot device.

If you copy uenv* correctly based on the above steps, the default u-boot
environment parameters should work fine, there is no need to set them again.

Alternative, you can also set the u-boot environment parameters to boot the board like the
following:

   $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS2,115200n8 earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02880000 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootwait ip=dhcp
   $ fatload mmc 1:1 0x82000000 Image; fatload mmc 1:1 0x88000000 k3-j784s4-evm.dtb; booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

6. Features
===========

Before using the features below, it is recommended that you first add
WRTEMPLATE to your build local.conf to add series tools (Such as: can/audio/ufs).

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:
	WRTEMPLATE = "feature/bsp-extras"

And it is recommended to refer to the "Foundational Components" of the sdk
release note "Processor SDK Linux for J784s4" from the TI web.

6.1 Multilib
------------

By default, this BSP is configured as a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit userspace.
If a full 32-bit filesystem is necessary, use the prefix "lib32-" before
the expected target image as follows:

	# bitbake lib32-wrlinux-image-std

6.2 CAN
-------

6.2.1 Verify
------------

Detail verification commands as below:

	# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 5000000 fd on
	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 5000000 fd on
	# candump can0 &
	# cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	# ip -d -s link show can0
	# ip -d -s link show can1

If can0 dumps data from can1, CAN feature works fine.

6.3 IPC
-------

The J784S4 SOC has integrated ARM Cortex A72 and others cores like: Cortex-R5F cores, C71x DSPs.
Through the CPSW9g virtual MAC, Cortex A72 can communicate with the remote cores using rpmsg.

In order to verify the IPC feature, need to build wrlinux with below steps:

Add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:

	KERNEL_FEATURES:append = " bsp/ti-j7xxx/ti-j7xxx-remoteproc.scc"

Built and install them:

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-xxx

Initialize all the available remote cores in the u-boot:
	$ rproc init;run boot_rprocs_mmc;

Then booting the system, the cores firmwares will be auto-download and get the
response.

A TI linux user-space applications "rpmsg_char_simple" is available to simple
test the IPC feature. Please refer to link "https://git.ti.com/cgit/rpmsg/ti-rpmsg-char/"
to get more detailed information.

Note:
Since both the u-boot and linux kernel download the firmwares from the
rootfs directory "/lib/firmware", so NFS is not applicable to this case.
Only WIC mode works fine.

6.4 Vision Apps
---------------

Vision Apps is a component within Processor SDK RTOS.

Vision Apps integrates different components within Processor SDK RTOS (PSDK RTOS)
like SysBIOS, PDK, OpenVX, Algorithms to realize system applications for vision
processing like surround view.

Vision Apps can be built or directly picked as out of the Box Demos from TI,
prebuilt PSDK RTOS and Demo Data can be obtained though TI's technical support.
It is recommended that you first refer to this guide document "out_of_box_j784s4.html"
while using the vision apps.

In order to run vision apps with full features on WRLinux, WRLinux should be built with:
	- Modify the ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf to add:
		WRTEMPLATE = "feature/bsp-extras"
		KERNEL_FEATURES:append = " bsp/ti-j7xxx/ti-j7xxx-remoteproc.scc"
	- Enable Graphics feature, please refer to "6.5.1 Build Image"

Run vision apps on EVM target in WRLinux + RTOS mode (via SD card boot) with below
steps:

6.4.1 Usage and verification
----------------------------

Step 1: Download Prebuilt PSDK RTOS

	$ cd {path/to/file}
	$ tar xf ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j784s4-evm-<version>-prebuilt.tar.gz

Step 2: Download Demo Data Sets
	psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx.tar.gz
	psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx_j784s4.tar.gz

Step 3: Prepare SD card
	$ sudo ./mk-linux-card.sh /dev/sdx

Note: make sure to give the correct device name to the following script, example
/dev/sda is typically local hard disk.

Step 4: Copy WRLinux Filesystem and Modify script
	$ cp path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-j78xx/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.tar.bz2 .
	$ sed -i 's/tisdk-default-image-${TI_DEV_BOARD}.tar.xz/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.tar.bz2/;43s/-I pxz -xf/-jxf/' install_to_sd_card.sh

Note: for the name wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-j78xx.tar.bz2, rootfs_type needs to be
specified according to the rootfs type, like std or sato.

Step 5: Install Filesystem and Boot Files
	$ ./install_to_sd_card.sh
	$ ./install_data_set_to_sd_card.sh <path/to/psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_xx_xx_xx.tar.gz>
	$ ./install_data_set_to_sd_card.sh <path/to/psdk_rtos_ti_data_set_ptk_xx_xx_xx.tar.gz>

Step 6: Run on EVM
 First time only:
	$ env default –a –f
	$ saveenv
	$ reset

 Run series demos:
	$ cd /opt/vision_apps
	$ source ./vision_apps_init.sh
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/python3.10/site-packages/dnf:/usr/lib
	$ ./run_app_tidl_avp.sh                 - Auto valet parking demo (needs display)

6.5 Graphics
------------

J784S4 device is enabled with 3D graphics accelerator based on the Rogue 8XE series
from Imagination Technologies Inc. 3D-graphics apps call userspace libraries to drive
the GPU directly by the graphics driver.

Due to the software license terms, we are not permitted to redistribute these components.
Due to this, we are unable to support the components (ti-img-rogue-driver, img-pvr-sdk and
ti-img-rogue-umlibs) or directly enable them (ti-img-rogue-driver, img-pvr-sdk and
ti-img-rogue-umlibs) within Wind River Linux. Please contact your silicon vendor if you have
any questions about the software license terms.

As below is the step how to build a graphics enabled system and verify the graphics feature:

6.5.1 Build Image
-----------------

  1) set BB_NO_NETWORK as '0' in <path-of-project>/build/conf/local.conf file.

  2) Launch bitbake to build an image with graphics support

     $ cd path_to_your_project
     $ . ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux
     $ . ./oe-init-build-env
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
DISTRO ?= "wrlinux-graphics"
MACHINE_FEATURES += " gpu"
WRL_RECIPES:wr-ti-j7xxx += 'img-pvr-sdk'
WRL_RECIPES:wr-ti-j7xxx += 'ti-img-rogue-umlibs ti-img-rogue-driver'
_EOF
     $ bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

6.5.2 Verify Graphic feature
----------------------------

Connect with DP port(J8) and run below command:

	#/usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2ChameleonMan
	#/usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2Coverflow
	#/usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2ExampleUI
	#/usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2FilmTV
	#/usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2MagicLantern
	#/usr/bin/SGX/demos/DRM/OGLES2Navigation

6.6 Build U-Boot
----------------

By default, the u-boot image is compiled and installed. If you want u-boot to be manually
compiled separately, use the following command：

	# bitbake u-boot-ti-staging

6.7 OSPI Flash
--------------

In order to use OSPI Flash, the configuration switch on J784s4 EVM board should be set with:

SW2.1=OFF

6.8 USB
-------

The J784S4-EVB supports a single USB interface. Therefore, the user must configure
for either the USB3.1 Type C interface [J4] or the USB2.0 Type A interface [J5]. Both can not
be operated simultaneously. The default system is the USB3.1 Type C interface, in order to
switch to the USB2.0 Type A interface, using the command on WRLinux shell:
	$ gpioset 1 12=1

Otherwise switch to the USB3.1 Type C interface, using the command on WRLinux shell:
	$ gpioset 1 12=0

Note: same as TI SDK, the bottom port of the two USB2.0 ports can not recognize
U disk, the top port of the two USB2.0 ports works fine.
